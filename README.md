# Beer-Api

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.22.

## About 

This project uses Punk API to get the data and display hundreds of beer recipes available. You can search the entire data using brewed dates or based on the desired alcohol content and even both. 
If you are a returning member and wanna look or search a specific beer, you can do that just by entering the name or the tagline. 
The descriptions of each and every beer is quite big so just to make it short I tried creating a pipe which places a ">>>" tag at the end of the text if the description exceeds a 
limit of 20 words. You can even view food pairing options that are good with those specific beers.
